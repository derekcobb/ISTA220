1.2 Discussion Questions
Answer the discussion questions in writing.

--1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?
(pg 116) A compound assignment operator is short hand for adding a value to a variable. The value on the left of the assignment operator has the arithmetic operator act on it by the value that is to the right of the
compound assignment operator
(class)
int num = 10;
num % = 3;
What is num? num is 1.

--2. List all the compound assignment operators.

(pg 116) *=, /=, %=, +=, -=

--3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by
50.
(self) var += 5 or variable = variable + 5; var = -= 50 or variable = variable - 50

--4. How long does a while loop run?
(pg 117) for as long as a condition is true i.e., when a condition evaluates to false

--5. What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
(pg 118) This code iterates forever, displaying an infinite number of zeros, because only the Console
WriteLine statement—and not the i++; statement—is executed as part of the while construct.

(Mr. Carter)
While (true)
{ listen();

--6. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of
them? What happens if you omit all of them?
(pg 122) A for loop possesses three parts. Yes. Yes. The loop goes on forever.

(Mr. Carter) Initiatlizer, terminal expression, update control variable

--7. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
(pg 124) By using a "do" statement

--8. What does the break statement do?
(pg 124) use the break statement to jump out of a switch statement. You can
also use a break statement to jump out of the body of an iteration statement.

--9. What does the continue statement do?
(pg 124)In contrast, the continue statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately (after reevaluating the Boolean expression).
