1. A local variable is a type of variable declared at the beginning of a block of code the variable is intended to be local to.

2. A statement is a command that performs an action, such as calculating a value and storing the result and displaying a message to a user.

3. Identifiers are the names that you use to identify the elements in your programs, such as namespaces, classes, methods, and variables.

4. A variable is a storage location that holds a value.

5. A method is a named sequence of statements, or block of code.

6. Primitive types and value types include many of the same data type labels. VAlue types refer to all of the primitive types or those most commonly used.

7. Not all operators apply to all data types. All the arithmetic operators on values of type *char*, *int*, *long*, *float*, *double*, or *decimal*. Except for the plus operator +, you cannot use the arithmetic operators on values of type string and you can't use any of them with values of type bool.

9. Use the method call Int32.Parse to convert a string value to an integer. By using string interpolation. The $ symbol is put at the start of the string to indicate that it's an interpolated string and that any expressions between the {and} characters should be evaluated and the result submitted in their place.

10. Precedence governs the order in which an expression's operators are evaluated. Associativity is the direction (left or right) in which the operands of an operator are evaluated. 4/2*6 "/" and "*" have same precedence associated left to right.

11. The definite assignment rule is having to assign a value to a variable before you can use it; otherwise the program will not compile.

12. In the expression x++, the variable x occurs first, so its value is used as the value of the expression b/f x is incremented. In the expression ++x, the operator occurs first, so its operation is performed before the value of x is evaluated at the result.

13. String interpolation is a recent feature added to C#, which renders many uses of the + operator obsolete for concatentatings strings. It turns strings into integers.

14. The "var" keyword asks the C# compiler to infer the type of a variable form an expression and use that type when declaring the variable.
